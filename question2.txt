Answer:
A comment is basically a text note that gives an explanation about the source code.
Furthermore, they act as documentation in the source code. We include comments to increase the readability of the program.
Besides, comments make it easy for the programmer to remember the complex things added to the code.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>We are here to explain the purpose of comments in html</h3>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <!-- <p>this is paragraph</p> -->
    <!-- Whatever we write inside this are not displayed in browser -->
</body>
</html>
